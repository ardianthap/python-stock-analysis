This project is a continuous process. 
The analysis done here is not to be used as a reference of a fully fledged financial analysis on any finance instruments attached

Here I analysed Stock prices in Indonesia, starting by analysing the most popular private bank: BCA (BBCA.JK), consequently comparing it with other major state-owned banks with the assumption that they have the pre-assumed financial stability being leveraged by the Nation's finance.
I also analysed the Indonesian Stock Market index to better understand any signals where crashes or market stress sentiments were present historically, hopefully using them as reference in entry and exit points clues when purchasing or selling stock.
